### Changelog

API only.

* **10-09-2023**
	* Function `CompactedDBG()::search()` takes additional arguments:
		* `get_nb_found_km`: boolean indicating whether to report in the output the number of found k-mers per query 
		* `get_ratio_found_km`: boolean indicating wether to report in the output the ratio of found k-mers per query
    
    	 Note that using either options de facto disable argument `ratio_kmers` and will impact running time as all *k*-mers of the queries will be searched for (`ratio_kmers` allows to stop the search early by detecting when the `ratio_kmers` threshold cannot be met).
* **15-06-2022**
	* Function `CompactedDBG()::write()` takes additional arguments with default values:
		* `compress_output` indicates whether the output should be compressed
		* `write_index_file` indicates whether an index file should be generated to enable faster graph loading
		* `GFA_output`, `FASTA_output` and `BFG_output` to select the output file format (previously, setting `outputGFA` set to false would automatically make `write()` output the graph in FASTA format).
		
		Beware that the new arguments come with default values which could override the default values of the previous versions of `write()`, e.g, the default value of parameter `FASTA_output` (`write()` with 8 parameters) could be used as the default value of parameter `verbose` if your code is not updated (`write()` with 5 parameters).
	* There exists two versions of `CompactedDBG::read()` and `ColoredCDBG::read()`, the "usual" (slower) graph reading function and the same function with an additional index graph file as input. Using the index graph file as input considerably speeds-up the graph loading in memory. The "usual" graph reading function will automatically use the graph index file if available.
* **04-28-2022**
	* Color files generated prior to version 1.0.6.2 are **not** compatible with version 1.0.6.2 and onward.
	* `CompactedDBG::simplify()` and `ColoredCDBG::simplify()` now return true even if no simplification was performed ("null-simplification" in case all input parameters are set to false). The goal is to only return false if the graph is invalid or in case of unexpected behavior. 
* **08-29-2018**
	* `UnitigColors::const_iterator` only considers now the k-mer positions of the unitig mapping provided in the `UnitigMap`/`UnitigColorMap` parameter of `UnitigColors::begin()`.
* **08-28-2018**
	* Functions `CDBG_Data_t::serialize()` and `CCDBG_Data_t::serialize()` have now one parameter which is a `const_UnitigMap`/`const_UnitigColorMap` reference representing the (reference) unitig to which the data are associated to.
* **08-23-2018**
	* Function `UnitigMap::toString()` was ambiguous as if it would generate the string of the mapped sequence or the string of the reference unitig used in the mapping. It has been replaced by two functions: `UnitigMap::mappedSequenceToString()` and `UnitigMap::referenceUnitigToString()`.
* **08-07-2018**
	* Add de Bruijn graphs merging functions (`CompactedDBG::merge()` and `ColoredCDBG::merge()`) and addition assignment operators (`CompactedDBG::operator+=()` and `ColoredCDBG::operator+=()`, same as `merge()` but uses only one thread).
	* Add de Bruijn graphs comparison functions `CompactedDBG::operator==()`, `CompactedDBG::operator!=()`, `ColoredCDBG::operator==()` and `ColoredCDBG::operator!=()`.
	* Delete `CompactedDBG::empty()` and `ColoredCDBG::empty()` to be consistent with STD containers (those functions were emptying the graph of its content while `empty()` of STD containers returns whether the container is empty). Now, to empty the graph, use `CompactedDBG::clear()` and `ColoredCDBG::clear()`.
    * Major changes in the abstract class `CDBG_Data_t` and `CCDBG_Data_t`:
    	* All the functions are now **non**-static.
    	* Function `join()` is renamed `concat()` and works a bit differently (have a look at the doc). Quickly, `join()` was concatenating two unitigs A and B such that the result was A=AB and B was deleted from the graph. Now, `concat()` deletes A and B from the graph and adds a new unitig C=AB.
    	* Function `sub()` is renamed `extract()`.
    	* Add the functions `merge()` and `clear()` which **must** be overloaded too in the derived class of `CDBG_Data_t` and `CCDBG_Data_t`.
